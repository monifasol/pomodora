## How to use Pomodora

Pomodora is a smart tomato that will help you managing your time following the Pomodoro Technique.  

This technique consists on splitting your working time in intervals of 25 minutes (for focus), separated by short breaks of 5 minutes (for resting).  
 
Pomodora is highly effective for achieving better productivity, concentration, and work discipline. It encourages you to focus on your work without distractions for 25 minutes, and uses short breaks to recharge your ability to concentrate. After 4 cycles of focus-rest times, it proposes you to do a longer break of 15/30 minutes.
